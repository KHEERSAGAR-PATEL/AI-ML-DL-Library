## 🧠 Lightweight ML/DL Library Engineered from Scratch

> A self-built, scalable machine learning and deep learning library written from the ground up — **no TensorFlow, no PyTorch**, just raw mathematics and engineering.

This project demonstrates the **fundamental mechanics of ML and DL systems**, implemented with precision and optimized for **speed, memory efficiency**, and **extensibility**. The models and optimizers have been rigorously validated on real datasets and show performance **within 5% of state-of-the-art frameworks** like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
